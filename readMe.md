# First Year Processing Solo Project
## Run Forest Run

## Summary
Your objective is to help Forest Grump to avoid as my flames as possible. However, no matter how much you run, you cannot escape a forest fire.

The reason was I was inspired to create this dark and simple game is because of the play on word, form the phrase, "Run Forrest Run" which gave me the idea of creating the game 'Run Forest Run' where you are running from a forest fire and no matter how far you run, you will be caught. The idea of this game is to see how far you may able to run.

## The Design

The design used for this game was created by myself, using Adobe Illustrator.

## Future works

* Be able to add new features 
* Fix certain errors too
* Revamp the design
